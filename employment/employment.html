			<h2><a id="healthcare">Healthcare and Music Therapist Positions</a></h2>
				<h3>Lake Charles Memorial Hospital</h3>
				<h4>Board Certified Music Therapist</h4>
				<h5>September 2014 - September 2020</h5>
				<p>In conjunction with the Activity Therapy department, I performed assessments and provided music 
					therapy sessions on the hospital's adolescent, adult, and geriatric behavioral health units. 
					This includes promoting leisure skills, formulating coping mechanisms, facilitating creative expression, 
					conducting crisis response, documenting patient progress, and remaining an active member of the patients' treatment team.</p>

				<h3>Baton Rouge General Medical Center</h3>
				<h4>Music Therapy Intern</h4>
				<h5>November 2015 - May 2016</h5>
				<p><b>Behavioral Health Unit:</b> I provided regular music therapy groups for patients of varying acuity; developing viable coping skills, 
					facilitating group songwriting, guided imagery and relaxation, and the occasional recreational music activity. 
					Heavy emphasis was placed on the recovery model of treatment, and our goal was to provide 
					patients with functional skills to integrate back into the community.<br><br>

				   <b>Arts in Medicine:</b> I contributed musical performances to the hospital to improve overall aesthetic quality. 
				   I also provided creative outlets for patients to reduce overall stress and address spiritual needs. 
				   Regular visits to patient rooms were made, and music was provided per patient request. Other settings included 
				   patient waiting areas, outpatient infusion lab, nurses' stations, and occasional hallways. I also drafted 
				   a program proposal for the implementation of and Arts in Medicine program into other hospitals in the state. 
				   Proposal is available for discussion.</p>
